# India's-stock-Market-Price-Prediction-with-web-deployment
end-to-end stock price prediction project!
a comprehensive system for forecasting stock market prices. This project goes from data analysis to a fully-deployed web application.

Here's a look at the process and the tools I used:
1. Data & Features: Starting with raw historical data, I used the ta library to engineer key technical indicators like RSI, MACD, and SMA. This enriched the data and gave my model more context to make accurate predictions.
2. Model Building: I built a predictive model using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network with TensorFlow and Keras. LSTMs are perfect for understanding patterns in time-series data, and they were crucial for this task.
3. Deployment: The final step was deployment. I used the Flask framework to create a user-friendly web application. The app takes new stock data and returns a real-time prediction, demonstrating a practical application of machine learning.

It was an incredible learning experience that brought together data science, deep learning, and web development.
